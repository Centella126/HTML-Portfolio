<h3>Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron</h3>
<p>
    Set in the Old West in the late 19th century, the film follows Spirit, a Kiger mustang stallion, 
    who is captured during the American Indian Wars by the United States Cavalry; he is eventually 
    freed by a Lakota man named Little Creek with whom he bonds, as well as a mare named Rain. 
    In contrast to the anthropomorphic style of animal characters in other animated features, Spirit
    and his fellow horses communicate with each other through non-linguistic sounds and body language

<h3>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>
    In the film, Miles goes on an adventure with Gwen Stacy / Spider-Woman across the Multiverse, 
    where he meets a team of Spider-People led by Miguel O'Hara / Spider-Man 2099 known as the 
    Spider-Society, but comes into conflict with them over handling a new threat in the form of the Spot.

<h3>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</h3>
<p>
    Set after the events of Shrek Forever After (2010), the story follows Puss in Boots, who teams up 
    with Kitty and Perrito to find the Last Wish of the fallen Wishing Star to restore eight of his nine lives. 
    They race against other fairy tale characters seeking the same treasure, while a sinister wolf hunts Puss himself.
